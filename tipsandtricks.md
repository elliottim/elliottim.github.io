### HUD Elements

![UI](images/demonstration.jpg)

The UI is found surrounding the edges of the screen.

- *Items* are located on the top left. The greenbar represents how much charge the item has. A full green bar means the item can be used.

- *Health* is located on the top left to the right of items, and can be made of many types of hearts.

- *Attributes* are located on the left side of the screen in a list fashion. This is an option called the Found Hud added with the Afterbirth+ DLC. Attributes can also be found on the pause menu.

- *Trinkets* are located on the bottom left.

- *The Map* is located on the top right.

- *Passive Items* you have collected are located on the right below the map.

- *Cards and Pills* are located on the bottom right. 

### Attributes

In the image above, Attributes top to bottom are:

- *Speed*: Displays the movement speed.

- *Tears*: Displays speed of shooting tears.

- *Damage*: Displays the damage done per tear.

- *Ramge*: Displays how far tears will travel.

- *Shot speed*: Displays how fast tears travel.

- *Luck*: Displays luck used in certain calculations.

- *Devil Chance*: Displays the chance for a Devil Room to appear at the end of a floor.

- *Angel Chance*: Displays the chance for an Angel Room to appear at the end of a floor.

Using pickups and obtaining Passive Items can improve attributes permanently, while using Items and holding Trinkets improve attributes temporarily.

Devil Chance and Angel Chance are determined uniquely compared to other attributes. Devil Chance is determined per-floor and it is lowered by taking damage to your red health. Angel Chance is determined after you do not enter Devil Rooms on a floor. Angel Chance also lowers if you take damage to your read health.
