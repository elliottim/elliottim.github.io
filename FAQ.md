## FAQ

Q. My game closed after I choose a file. What do I do?

A. There are many reasons why this could be happening. If you have downloaded mods, you should try Unsubscribing from the mods to uninstall them.
Try uninstalling them one at a time to see which mod crashes the game. You can also ask questions on the mod's Steam Workshop page in the comments section.
Additionally, your game files may have been corrupted. You can fix this by either uninstalling and reinstalling the game, or verifying the game files.
To verify your game files, click the cogwheel-shaped button on the game's Library page, click Properties on the drop down menu, click the Local Files tab, 
then click the ```Verify integrity of game files...``` button and follow the instructions. This will check for bad files and replace them as needed.

Q. I completed my first run of the game without dying, but I didn't unlock anything?

A. Make sure you don't have any mods enabled when completing your first playthrough. You can either Unsubscribe and uninstall the mods, or disable them through
the Mod menu in the game. Some mods will even warn you at the beginning of a run if you are in danger of not progressing or unlocking items.
Sadly, you must complete another run before progression with mods will be enabled, even if you already completed a run with mods enabled. 

Q. I don't have the same UI elements as the tutorial and some of the controls aren't the same. What's up?

A. This tutorial is written for the complete version of The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth, which includes all DLC up to The Binding of Isaac: Repentance.
Most information is still applicable, even if there are minor differences in HUD elements or controls. 

Q. I unlocked a new item, but I don't have it when I start a new run. What gives?

A. Unlocking a new item doesn't mean it appears in your inventory. Unlocking items means it has a chance of appearing during a run now.
Even if it does not seem like much, you'll be seeing many new and better items in no time.

Q. What's XXX do?

A. While this is a guide to the basics of the game, an important aspect of the game is experimentation with many of the items. Use the item with the spacebar,
check your attributes, shoot a bunch of tears and see what's different! Even if you don't know what something does immediately, you'll get the hang
of any new items you find in no time.
